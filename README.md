Hello Everybody These are the algorithms that i coded this summer for the course of Introduction to ML . I ve had enjoyed every moment of it . 
These are the titles of algorithms:
1.  Linear Regression
2.  Logistic Regression
3.  Multivariate Linear Regression
4.  Steepest Descent 
5.  Naive Bayes
6.  kNN
7.  K-Means
8.  Golden Section
9.  Bisection
10. Gradient Boosting
11. Newton-Raphson
12. Radial Basis Function
13. Finding Extremum points
14. Fibonacci
15. Solving Hyperbolic Functions
16. Non-Linear Regression
17. Jacobian
18. Sigmoid Function
19. Solving Exponential Function
20. Iteration&Adding Noise for solving basic models
